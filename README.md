 ### Contact: trungnhan21.12@gmail.com  
 ### Based on ML.NET sample at https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/blob/master/README.md  
 ### My git: https://github.com/nhannt201  
Guide:  
>Replace `C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\Scan\` to folder containing the images to your classification!  
>Replace `C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\Result\` to Result folder in the Guide folder  
>Here is the basic code that categorizes 7 things:
- People (ConNguoi)
- Animals (DongVat)
- Items (DoVat)
- Flowers
- Document (TaiLieu)
- Nature (ThienNhien)
- Food (ThucAn)

You must not rename in the Result folder, the classification may be corrupted!
You can `Console.WriteLine` Name of images with `result.Prediction`
Here is the test code. Thank you for your interest in this project!
